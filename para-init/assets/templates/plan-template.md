# Plan: {TASK_NAME}

**Date:** {DATE}
**Status:** In Review

---

## Objective

[Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished]

## Spec

**File:** `context/data/{DATE}-{TASK_NAME}-spec.yaml` (or equivalent contract)

[Brief description of what the spec covers]

## Stubs

Stub source files to be created before writing tests:

- `[path/to/stub-file.ts]` - [Purpose]
- `[path/to/stub-file2.ts]` - [Purpose]

## Approach

[Step-by-step methodology for implementation]

1. [First major step]
2. [Second major step]
3. [Third major step]

## Risks & Edge Cases

[Potential issues to watch out for]

- **Risk 1:** [Description and mitigation]
- **Risk 2:** [Description and mitigation]

## Success Criteria

[Measurable outcomes that define completion]

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all implementation steps

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

[What unit tests need to be written]

- [Test category 1]
- [Test category 2]

### Integration Tests

[What integration tests need to be written]

- [Test scenario 1]
- [Test scenario 2]

### Manual Verification

[Manual steps to verify correctness]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

## Implementation Steps

[Detailed breakdown of execution]

1. **[Step 1 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
   - [Sub-task]
   - **Tests:** [What tests to write for this step]

2. **[Step 2 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
   - [Sub-task]
   - **Tests:** [What tests to write for this step]

3. **[Step 3 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
   - [Sub-task]
   - **Tests:** [What tests to write for this step]

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Does this approach align with project architecture?
- [ ] Are all edge cases considered?
- [ ] Is the scope appropriate (not too large)?
- [ ] Are success criteria measurable?
- [ ] Does each implementation step have associated tests defined?
- [ ] Is a spec file referenced?

**Next Step:** Please review this plan. When you're ready, run `para-execute` to begin implementation.
