# Phase {PHASE_ID}: {PHASE_NAME}

> **Parent plan:** `{DATE}-{TASK_NAME}.md`
> **Estimated time:** {ESTIMATED_TIME}
> **Prerequisite:** {PREREQUISITES_OR_NONE}
> **Outcome:** {ONE_SENTENCE_DESCRIBING_WHAT_IS_TRUE_WHEN_DONE}

## Objective

[Clear, specific statement of what this phase accomplishes. Should be independently valuable and testable.]

---

## Key Context from Master Plan

[Copy (not reference) the specific decisions, principles, and contracts that are needed for this phase. The test: "Could someone execute this sub-plan without reading the master plan?"]

**Relevant principles:**
- [Principle from master plan that applies to this phase]
- [Principle from master plan that applies to this phase]

**Relevant architecture decisions:**
- [Decision]: [Choice] -- [brief rationale]
- [Decision]: [Choice] -- [brief rationale]

**Contracts this phase implements or depends on:**
```
[Interface definitions, API shapes, or message schemas needed for this phase]
```

## Scope

### In Scope

- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Item 1 -- which phase handles it]
- [Item 2 -- which phase handles it]

## Implementation Steps

> Each checklist item below maps to one git commit. The checkbox text is the commit message.
> Tests come BEFORE the implementation they cover (TDD).

- [ ] **Write {contract/unit} test suite for {component}**
  - [Sub-task]
  - **Tests:** `TestName` -- [what it asserts]. Won't compile yet (no types). That's expected.

- [ ] **Write acceptance test skeleton for {feature}**
  - [Sub-task]
  - **Tests:** `TestAcceptanceName` -- stays red until implementation is complete

- [ ] **Implement {component}**
  - **File(s):** `path/to/file.ext`
  - [Sub-task]
  - **Makes green:** [which tests from above now pass]

- [ ] **Implement {component}**
  - **File(s):** `path/to/file.ext`
  - [Sub-task]
  - **Makes green:** [which tests now pass]

## Phase-Specific Risks

- **Risk 1:** [Description]
  - *Mitigation:* [How to handle]

- **Risk 2:** [Description]
  - *Mitigation:* [How to handle]

## Green Tests After This Phase

- {GREEN_OR_RED} {Test suite 1} -- [brief description]
- {GREEN_OR_RED} {Test suite 2} -- [brief description]
- {GREEN_OR_RED} {Test suite 3} -- [brief description]
- {GREEN_OR_RED} E2E acceptance test -- [red if not yet, green if this phase completes it]

[Use checkmarks for green, crosses for still-red. This should match the progressive regression rule in the master plan.]

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `path/to/new/file.ext` | Create | [What it does] |
| `path/to/new/file_test.ext` | Create | [What it tests] |
| `path/to/existing/file.ext` | Modify | [What changes and why] |

**Next Step:** Once reviewed and approved, run `para-execute --phase={PHASE_ID}` to begin implementation.
