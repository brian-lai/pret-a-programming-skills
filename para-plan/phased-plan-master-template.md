## Objective

[Clear statement of the overall goal. 2-3 sentences max.]

---

## Core Principles

1. **[Principle 1].** [One-sentence explanation]
2. **[Principle 2].** [One-sentence explanation]
3. **[Principle 3].** [One-sentence explanation]

[3-6 opinionated principles specific to this task. Not generic truisms.]

```

### Data/Event Flow

```
[Step-by-step flow showing how data moves through the system]
```

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| [Decision 1] | [What was chosen] | [Why] | [What was considered and why it lost] |
| [Decision 2] | [What was chosen] | [Why] | [What was considered and why it lost] |

## Responsibility Split

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---------------|-------|
| [Responsibility 1] | [Component/module that owns it] |
| [Responsibility 2] | [Component/module that owns it] |

---

## Graceful Degradation

| Failure Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Dependency 1] down | [What happens -- error message, fallback, retry] |
| [Dependency 2] down | [What happens] |
| [Dependency 3] returns errors | [What happens] |

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Title | Scope | Est. Time |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **{PHASE_1_ID}** | {PHASE_1_NAME} | [Brief scope] | [Time] |
| **{PHASE_2_ID}** | {PHASE_2_NAME} | [Brief scope] | [Time] |
| **{PHASE_3_ID}** | {PHASE_3_NAME} | [Brief scope] | [Time] |

### Progressive Regression Rule

```
Phase {PHASE_1_ID} -> [which test suites go green]
Phase {PHASE_2_ID} -> + [which additional test suites go green]
Phase {PHASE_3_ID} -> + [which additional test suites go green, including E2E]
```

## Execution Plan

1. **Review all phases** - Ensure entire approach is sound before starting
2. **Execute Phase 1** - Run `para-execute --phase=1`
3. **Review & Merge Phase 1** - Push branch, create PR, review, merge to main
4. **Execute Phase 2** - Run `para-execute --phase=2` (starts from updated main)
5. **Continue** - Repeat execute -> review -> merge for remaining phases
6. **Final Verification** - Ensure overall success criteria met
7. **Archive** - Run `para-archive` when complete

### Branch Strategy

Each phase uses a separate branch:
- Phase 1: `para/{task-name}-phase-1`
- Phase 2: `para/{task-name}-phase-2`
- Phase 3: `para/{task-name}-phase-3`

Each branch starts from `main` (with previous phases already merged).

## New Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| [Component 1] | `path/to/component/` | [What it does] |
| [Component 2] | `path/to/component/` | [What it does] |
